# NVsoulfire
this is a custom neovim configuration that copies the configuration in my home directory.
this is a directory that is mainly indended to be a backup but was made public and you can feel free to use it.

if you dont know how to install a custom config the steps are the following:

  1. get the latest version of neovim in order to make shure all packages work

  2. make a configuration folder in ~/.config/nvim/
  if you aldready have this folder delete your own config files or place it in a seperate folder

  3. put all of the files in this git repository in your nvim folder. If you are a git noob and struggle to copy the git files you can use the git clone command

  4. load up neovim by entering nvim into the terminal 

  if nothing happens make shure that all of the files are in the root of the nvim directory and not nested inside NVsoulfire
